# Projects from "Data Science" course at Yandex

The following is the list of the projects I have completed during my studies in [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/data-scientist/).
For this moment I have completed 9 our 14 projects.


| Project name  | Description | Libraries |
| :------------- | :------------- |:-------------|
| [1. Music preferences](01_yandex_music)  | We compare muisc preferences of Yandex.Music users from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Data preparation, cleaning, exploratory analysis. | *pandas* |
| [2. Ð¡redit analysis](02_credit_scoring) | Effect of family status, number of children and income on credit repayment are considered. Data preparation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, variable categorization. | *pandas*|
| [3. Real estate analysis](03_real_estate_prices)| Predicting the market price of real estate in St. Petersburg region for detecting anomalies and fraud.. Defining features.  Data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, correlation between the real estate price and different parameters. | *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot* |
| [4. Profinability of tariffs for a telecom](04_telecom_tariff) | User behavior analysis for tariff profitability determination. Data preparation, cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing. | *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *numpy*, *scipy.stats* |
| [5. Video games polularity](05_games)|  Analysis of historical data on games issued till 2016. Popularity prediction depending on platform, genre and market. Exploratory data analysis, user portrait analysis, hypothesis testing.| *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *numpy*, *scipy.stats* |
| [6. Tariff recommendation](06_users_classification)| Application of Machine learning models (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression) for classification of users. Adjusting of hyperparameter is perform.  The training data are historical data on user behavior.  The model can be used as recommender of suitable tariff to users. | *pandas*, *sklearn*, *numpy* |
| [7. Bank customer churn modeling](07_bank_customer_churn_modeling) | Building a machine learning model that predict customer churn using historical data on customer behavior.| *pandas*, *sklearn*, *numpy*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *GridSearchCV* |
| [8. New oil well location](08_oil_extraction_location) | Creating a model that analyzes data from three locations for the choising the region for new oil wells that will maximize profits while minimizing risk. Profits and risk were predicted using Bootstrap technique. Linear Regression was used as a model. | *pandas*, *sklearn*, *numpy*, *scipy.stats*, *seaborn*, *matplotlib.pyplot* |
| [9. Gold recovery coefficient](09_gold_recovery) | Developing ML model that predict the efficiency of gold extracted from raw matherial. Three models have been tested: LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor. Hyperparameters search where performed with cross-validation using  GridSearchCV. | *pandas*, *sklearn*, *numpy*, *seaborn*, *matplotlib.pyplot* , *GridSearchCV*|
| [10. Customers' personal data encryption](10_customer_data_encryption) | To be done |  |
| [11. Car prices prediction](11_car_prices_boosting) | To be done |  |
| [12. Number of taxi orders forecast](12_time_series) | To be done |  |
| [13. Sentiment analysis](13_nlp) | To be done |  |
| [14. Analytics of airline customers' preferences](14_sql) | To be done |  |
